##Employee management system

I used Laravel (a PHP web application framework), Laravel Blade (a templating engine including layouts, sections, and components), MySQL, and Bootstrap (a CSS framework for creating responsive and attractive components). So far, I have successfully implemented user authentication, and the dashboard provides an overview of the number of employees, employee profiles, leave requests, salaries, schedules, and users.
